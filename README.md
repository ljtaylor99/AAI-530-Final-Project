# AAI-530-Final-Project

This repository contains the code and data set for a final project for the course AAI 530 at University of San Diego. Below is a directory describing the files in the repository. In this project we use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and K-means Clustering to predict the demand for rideshares in an area. The dataset used in this project comes from another Github repository created by FiveThirtyEight. Dataset includes information about Uber rides in the Tri-State Area of New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, from April - September 2014 .

Information contained in the data set is as follows:
- **Date/Time**: The date and time of the pickup.
- **Lat:** The latitude of the pickup location.
- **Lon:** The longitude of the pickup location.
- **Base:** The associated TLC base company code of the pickup.

### **AAI530_Final.ipynb**
File contains preliminary EDA and the code for K-means CLustering and LSTM 

### **Uber Data APR-JUNE.zip**
A compressed CSV containing the Uber ride information spanning April -  June 2014. In order to speed up the upload process we split the data set into two seperate files.

### **Uber Data JUL-SEP.zip**
A compressed CSV containing the Uber ride information spanning July -  September 2014.
